# Static Comp Challenge

## [Deployable Link]()

## Overview 

While the primary focus of Turing's FE Mod 2 is expanding our understanding of JavaScript with iterator methods, unit testing, and fetch API - there is always room for improving HTML and CSS. Over the two week winter break this inning I was looking for extra challenges in those languages. 

The original [spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/static-comp-challenge.html) required sticking to the exact design in terms of layouts and colors, but giving creative liberties to images, names, and responsive design. Given the opportunity I will always try to include Marvel, so below is my attempt at giving my own flavor to matching a static comp.

#### Responsive Design

Subtle response in the form of a pulse/blink animation to the navigational features in the header of the page. Anything that might offer interaction with the user should be clear.

My favorite feature of the composition is the responsive design to scrolling over each profile photo. Because it's Marvel themed, each profile card is the Avenger's personal identity and on mouse hover the photo switches to reveal their superhero persona.

The static site is set up to have an arrow button on each card that would flip it around to potentially reveal more information about that person's profile. There is a responsive hover feature that changes that button to have a linear-gradient of that hero's color palette from their movies. 

I also provided the unique link and playlist name for each profile to make it a little more personalized. 


## Successes

I only spent an hour on this each day I worked on it so I was happy to finish this in just 2-3 days of working on it. I had also never used CSS ``display: grid`` before and it was nice to get a bit more experience with it.

## Challenges

Not matching the exact colors and icons used for certain aspects of the spec. When the spec is just a screen shot of something that has already been created you can't use Chrome Color Picker extensions in order to get the RGB/Hex codes. However, I know in the real world the designers of the composition would be providing exact colors for me.
